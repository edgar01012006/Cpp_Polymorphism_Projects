# 🎵 C++ Practice Assignment — Symphony of Polymorphism: Orchestra Simulation

🧭 Overview  
In this project, you will design and implement a simple object-oriented orchestra simulation using runtime polymorphism in C++.  
The goal is to demonstrate how virtual functions allow different derived classes to provide specific implementations while being accessed through base class pointers.
